                  <p>Feelz is a mixtape by Lil Peep, released on August 25, 2015, during the early stages of his career.
                 As one of his lesser-known but deeply personal projects, Feelz offers a raw and unfiltered look into Peep�s
                 emotional world and creative process.
                  It was released independently on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, and, like much of his early work, carries the
                  unmistakable DIY spirit and genre-blending style that would later define his legacy.
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  The mixtape is a short yet emotionally potent collection, consisting of just seven tracks. Despite its brevity,
                  Feelz captures the essence of Lil Peep�s early sound: lo-fi production, melancholic guitar loops, ethereal synths,
                  and deeply introspective lyrics. The beats are often minimal and ambient, allowing Peep�s vocals and lyrics to take
                  center stage. Much of the production was handled by members of the GothBoiClique and other underground producers,
                  including Greaf and Nedarb.
